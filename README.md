# Iron Road for Children iOS App (IRFC) 
## Getting started
This project uses XcodeGen for generating the Xcode project.

If not installed, you can install XcodeGen using brew:
```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

Generate the Xcode project (run in root folder, where the project.yml lives):
```bash
xcodegen
```

This command must also be run after switching branches and it's advisable to also run it after a git pull.

Open the IronRoadForChildren.xcodeproj in Xcode and start coding :)
